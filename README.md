# History-Trek
My startup
We have all faced difficulties in studying history. It can really be hard.
To facilitate the study of this subject and to raise interest in the history of young generations, I came up with this project. 


# The essence of the project is that you can directly ask what you want from different historical figures. For example: if you don't understand the essence or motives of some historical ruler, why not ask him directly? You can make one person responsible for one era so far, so as not to load your project heavily with characters. Let's say: Otto von Bismarck is responsible for the XIX century because he more or less participated in all the events of this era. That is, you can ask the German Chancellor himself how this transition to industrial industry took place in the countries of the XIX century. The same can be done not only with history but also with science, for example, you can directly ask Albert Einstein how he got to the theory of relativity.


# Implementation:
The application will work in the form of Yandex Alice. That is, it will be such a chat, only with historical figures. And of course, you will have to link an artificial intelligence to them like a gpt chat, where you will need to upload all the information about their activities, and there may be personal letters to determine their possible answers to certain questions. You can also connect voice simulation or 3D models to diversify communication. 


# Possible problems and their solutions:
Since the application will be used by people of all ages, it is possible that people will ask not very correct and convenient questions for certain historical figures. To do this, we will limit artificial intelligence so that it simply does not give an answer to such questions, for example, "I haven't found it yet" or "I won't answer it." And in extreme cases, the AI may take offense and not respond during the day.


# Of course, at the beginning there is not enough server power to implement everything at once. Therefore, to begin with, I want to focus on the history of Belarus. Moreover, this section of history is still more difficult to study. In the future, it will be possible to realize world history.


Copyright for the use of character images. As I understand it, it is connected only with paintings and music, which means you can create your own images of historical character


# Advantages of the project: 

• Help in the study of history

• Raising interest in history among the population 

• Raising the general level of development and diversity of the population. 

I also have several name options for this project.

You can also enter a system of accounts and achievements. Where you earn yourself points by asking questions. The fewer people asked the same thing, the more points you get. Thus, you can learn something new and compete with your friends.
